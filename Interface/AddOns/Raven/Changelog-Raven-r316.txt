Add line in tooltip showing the listed spell ids (only when alt and control keys are held down when mousing over the bar/icon) from imported spell lists such as in the Raven_Filter_Leila addon. This is a quality of life improvement for maintainers of such lists, allowing them to find listed spell ids for spells that have multiple associated spell ids. This has essentially no impact on the primary code path.

Restored part of the bar refresh optimization that was removed in r308 to address an issue with multiple instances of the same debuff from multiple mobs (that issue remains fixed in this release). This change both reduces overhead and minimizes visibility of the clock animation flicker that sometimes happens when clock direction is set to true.

Fix ghost bar detection to make sure don't miss any candidates when spells expire. Make sure ghost bars always display 0 time left.
Add ability to display just the tooltip number on a custom bar when that option is enabled (this is done by embedding the string TT# in a custom label).

Fixed issue with ghost bars being displayed every time spell was refreshed. Should now only show when spell expires and never when the same spell is displayed on a active timer bar in the same bar group.
Added option to leave gaps between groups of bars in Debuff Tracker and Buff Tracker type bar groups when headers are not being displayed. The headers are actually still being generated (which is necessary to provide the "right-click to hide capability") but they are invisible.
CPU performance was improved somewhat by less frequently checking Blizzard frame settings and by a rewrite of how bar attributes are passed to the graphics functions.

   M /trunk/Main.lua

Detect elapsed bars in the display code and remove them if they were not caught by the bar processing code.
Vehicle-related aura events now also force player aura updates (this is the probable cause for some vehicle debuffs not being detected as elapsed).
Vehicle auras now are only included in player auras when the vehicle UI is visible (this was noticeable on Timeless Isle when hitching a ride on an albatross).
Remove highlight and cooldown overlay code related to the Macaroon addon (Macaroon was replaced with Ion a while back and this code was never updated to work with Ion).
