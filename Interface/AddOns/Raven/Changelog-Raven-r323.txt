Remove class spell info in the preset files. Clean up class-specific conditions in the preset files. Clean up readme.txt file. Recognize latest GUID format change.

When testing this on the PTR or beta servers, please download and include as a separate addon the latest Ace3 release from wowace. This is to ensure that the correct libraries are being used.

This build now includes all changes planned prior to the release of 6.0.2. Please report any bugs found while testing on the PTR to the curseforge forum thread for Raven under General Addons.

Changed how new bars are created in custom bar groups to requiring spell names or numeric ids to be entered for each new buff/debuff/cooldown bar. This removes the dependence on the preset tables being accurate for all races, classes and specializations. This will significantly reduce the update requirements for the preset tables going into WoD and sets the stage for reducing the amount of info encoded in presets.

Removed the localizations for KR, CN and TW since they have gotten too far out-of-date to be included in this release. The EN localization has been cleaned up some, as well.

Remove the capability of adding buff/debuff/cooldown info on action bar buttons. This feature will not be supported for WoD due to the challenge of maintaining it given dependence on action bar addons. This feature has always been somewhat confusing to people who don't expect a buff/debuff/cooldown addon to alter the appearance of action bars.

Fix more tests for returned values from Blizzard API that changed from nil or 1 to true or false. This should fix some issues with clicking on anchors and various condition tests.

Change packager to pick up latest versions of Ace3 library. This is intended to get the alpha release of the libraries for WoD.

First round of edits for WoD expansion.

This is NOT COMPATIBLE with MoP on live servers! Only use this on the beta servers!

Note that the custom border is hidden by default due to a bug on the beta servers with custom textures.
