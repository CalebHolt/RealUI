How to contribute to RealUI
---------------------------

## Localization ##

If you know a language other than English, this is the easiest way to contribute. There is a [localization project](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/realui-localization/localization) on Curse where you can easily see what phrases need translation or review.

## Bug Reports ##

Before you report a bug, [follow these steps](http://www.wowinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=500891) first. In addition to checking the forums, also check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RealUI/RealUI/issues) here on GitHub, to ensure that there isn't an existing issue reported.

### Submitting A (Good) Bug Report ###
Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on OSX and Windows.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Which version of RealUI are you using?** You can get the exact version by opening the advanced options with `/realadv`, and looking at the header.
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of RealUI) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of RealUI?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of RealUI from [the releases page](https://github.com/RealUI/RealUI/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* **What addons _not_ included in RealUI do you have installed?**.
